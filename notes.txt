in scrolling, make 'sincelastscroll' variable so if the user scrolls and the page start to scroll, the variable gets set, and if the user consecutively
 scroll after he/she doesn't have to wait.
IN LIGHT OF PREVIOUS: MAYBE!: make the 'change page on scroll' time last as long time as the first animation exits
