                Hello! <br>
                I'm Jonathan Sparvath
                a fullstack developer with emphasis on the backend, but I absolutely love working on the front end as well.
                Most of my free time is spent learning the newest shiny tool or framework, but I'm also a big proponent of learning the basics before moving on.
            </p>
            <p  class="sub-headline transition3 bread-element" :class="{exit: exitRoute, outDown: outDown}">
                I also have an interest in visual design that I exersize on personal projects.
                When Iâ€™m not in front of my computer, I love to play pingpong, enjoy the nightlife or travel the world.
            </p>
