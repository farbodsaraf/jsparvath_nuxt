          <b>Hello!</b> <br>
          I'm <b>Jonathan Sparvath</b>
          a fullstack developer with emphasis on the backend, but I absolutely love working on the front end as well.
          Most of my free time is spent learning the newest shiny tool or framework, but I'm also a big proponent of
          learning the basics before moving on.
        </p>
        <p class=" transition3 body-text" :class="{exit: exitRoute, outDown: outDown}">
          I also have an interest in visual design that I exersize on personal projects.
          When Iâ€™m not in front of my computer, I love to play pingpong, enjoy the nightlife or travel the world.
