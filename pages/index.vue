          I'm <span class="booold">Jonathan Sparvath</span> a fullstack developer with emphasis on the backend, but I
          absolutely love working on the front end as well.
          Most of my free time is spent learning the newest shiny tool or framework, but I'm also a big proponent of
          learning the basics before moving on.

          I also have an interest in visual design that I exersize on personal projects.
          When Iâ€™m not in front of my computer, I love to play pingpong, enjoy the nightlife or travel the world.
