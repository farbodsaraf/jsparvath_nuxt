            Hello! <br>
            I'm Jonathan Sparvath
            a fullstack developer with emphasis on the backend, but I absolutely love working on the front end as well.
            Most of my free time is spent learning the newest shiny tool or framework, but I'm also a big proponent of learning the basics before moving on.
        </p>

        <p  class="sub-headline transition3 bread-element" :class="{exit: exitRoute, outDown: outDown}">
            I also have an interest in visual design that I exersize on personal projects.
            When Iâ€™m not in front of my computer, I love to play pingpong, enjoy the nightlife or travel the world.
        </p>
